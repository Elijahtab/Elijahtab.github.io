## Project Overview

Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we understand and engage with the world, and history is no exception. This project explores the intersection of AI technologiesâ€”language modeling, voice synthesis, and animationâ€”to create an interactive digital version of President John F. Kennedy.

Our team set out to prototype what it might look like to hold a conversation with a historic figure. We chose JFK due to the extensive archive of audio, video, and writings available, as well as his cultural familiarity. The goal was to create a believable and expressive simulation that evokes not just how JFK sounded, but how he thought and interacted.

##  Technical Stack & Implementation

###  OpenAI Integration for Personality Emulation

At the heart of the project was a custom OpenAI assistant. I used JFKâ€™s public speeches, interviews, letters, and secondary sources (biographies, news coverage, etc.) to shape the assistantâ€™s tone, diction, and ideological leanings. Responses were prompted to stay grounded in this curated corpus to reduce hallucination and better emulate historical plausibility.

###  Voice Synthesis with ElevenLabs

To add auditory realism, we integrated ElevenLabsâ€™ voice synthesis platform. Using archival audio, we constructed a vocal
