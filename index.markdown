Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been drawn to systems—whether they were on a screen or out in the wild. I spent hours dissecting game mechanics, trying to find the most efficient way to conquer the world or setup chains of production. That curiosity grew into a love for programming and AI: tools that let me build my own worlds and intelligent systems from scratch.

At the same time, hiking became the way I reset. There’s something about reading a trail map, planning a route, and testing yourself against terrain that feels a lot like solving a strategy problem, except the feedback is in sore legs, not log files.

Now, I try to bring that same mindset into everything I do. Whether I’m designing game tools in Unity, exploring how large language models interact with players, or climbing a peak with a paper map and no service, I’m always thinking about patterns, decision-making, and the systems that shape our experience.
